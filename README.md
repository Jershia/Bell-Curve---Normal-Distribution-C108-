# Bell-Curve---Normal-Distribution-C108-
  * *We have imported **plotly.figure_factory** *
  * *Most of the graphs follow normal distribution.*
### Steps 
  * *We need to import pandas,csv and figure_factory from plotly*
  * *We have created two arrays,count and dice* 
  * *We have created two variables to give a random number between 1 and 6*
  * *Then we have created a for loop which works from 0-100 to append the values of arrays.*
  * *Then by using **create_displot** we have displayed the graph and also used **show_hist** as false to not show the bars or histograms*
