# Bell Curve-C108
 ### *Learnt About*
  * *We learned about the bell curve - normal distribution and how to plot it.*
  * *Most of the graphs follow normal distribution.*
  * *In python,arrays means lists.* 
### *Steps To Form A bell curve or normal distribution*
  * *We visited random.org site and rolled the dice multiple times and recorded the different sums in a file.*
  * *We have imported pandas,csv and figure_factory from plotly.*
  * *We wrote python code to get the random dice numbers 100 times and store in a list.*
  * *Using plotly express we plotted the list on the bar graph*
  * *We have created two lists,count and dice* 
  * *We have created two variables to give a random number between 1 and 6*
  * *Then we have created a for loop which works from 0-100 to append the values of lists.*
  * *Then we drew the distribution plot using plotly's figure_factory module.*
  * *Then by using **create_displot** we have displayed the graph and also used **show_hist** as false to not show the bars or histograms*
